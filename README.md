# What is the purpose of this organization?

This journey started a short time after ChatGPT was released to the public in late 2022. Dustin & Ricky were talking about what would be necessary for AI to start writing better code. We came to the conclusion, that when given a ‚robust‘ programming language like Rust and combining it with an AI enhanced Compiler or something along those lines, the AI might be able to reflect on it’s own mistakes and correct it’s code. This could potentially lead to the development of new „AI-stable-“ or „AI-robust-“ programming languages, which will no longer focus on the human developer primarily, but the machine instead. 

A first step towards this goal might be the use of robust programming languages like Rust and using an AI to talk to the compiler or enhance the compiler with AI to get a better understanding of what the coder (be it human or machine) is trying to achieve and thus give even better feedback, on which the coder can build it’s next step. 

In this scenario, human developers would no longer be producing code primarily, but instead be interacting with and debugging or enhancing the code generated by the machine. We think that Rust might be the cornerstone of this whole journey, which is why we chose to dedicate this organization to the purpose of learning the Rust Programming language.
